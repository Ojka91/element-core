This is a non profit project we've built inspired by [Element Silver Edition board game](https://ratherdashinggames.com/games/element-silver.html)

This is not an official game and we have no relation with the owners of the board game [Element Silver Edition](https://ratherdashinggames.com/games/element-silver.html)

# Element - backend

Backend service for non official element board game online 

Frontend project can be found [here](https://github.com/Arkk92/element-front)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

* [NodeJS version 20 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - or use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install)

### Running for first time

If you just want to run the  game execute:
```
make run
```

This will run docker compose building the image seting up a volume for hot reloading and seting up a redis. All ready to work!


### Other commands
```
make run-build // same as make run but forcing the docker compose building flag
make test // run tests locally
make build // install required packages locally
```

You can try and run the project locally without docker (using package.json commands) but this is not recommended since it won't setup redis and basically the server won't really work
