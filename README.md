This is a non profit project we've built inspired by [Element Silver Edition board game](https://ratherdashinggames.com/games/element-silver.html)

This is not an official game and we have no relation with the owners of the board game [Element Silver Edition](https://ratherdashinggames.com/games/element-silver.html)
