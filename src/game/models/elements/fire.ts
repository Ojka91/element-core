 * Fire class
 * @brief   Once placed next to other fire element it reacts adding one extra Fire in the opposite side of the already placed fire.
 *          If a Water, Earth/Mountain or Sage occupies the opposite space, NO extra Fire is added. If it is Wind/Whirlwind element then Wind is replaced by Fire.
 *          Extra Fire elements can only be placed orthogonally, NEVER diagonally.
 *          Extra Fire elements do not generate extra Fire elements.
